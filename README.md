# Basic Flutter App

A clean Flutter project that demonstrates a modern login and sign-up UI, along with a dynamic home screen that fetches a list of food categories from a public API.

## ✨ Features

* Login screen with validation and SnackBar/Toast feedback
* Sign-up screen with matching clean UI
* TextFormField inputs wrapped in a reusable widget (`AppTextField`)
* **Consistent app-wide theming** using `ThemeData` and a centralized `AppTheme`
* Color palette extracted into `AppColors` for easy reuse
* Home screen that fetches and displays food categories from the network
* Bottom navigation bar to switch between Home, Login, and **Profile**
* **Profile screen** added and is currently under development
* **Bloc state management** implemented for Login and Signup workflows
* **Firebase integration** for authentication (login & signup)

## 🧠 State Management

This app uses the **Bloc (Business Logic Component)** pattern for state management:

* Handles form validation and UI state changes efficiently
* Bloc logic is separated for Login and Signup (`login_bloc`, `signup_bloc`)
* Emits loading, success, and failure states for better user feedback and flow control

## 🔥 Firebase

The project integrates **Firebase** for:

* User authentication (login/signup)
* Real-time validation and backend communication

Firebase is initialized using the `firebase_core` package and configured with `firebase_options.dart` generated by FlutterFire CLI.

## 🎨 Theming

The app applies global theming using `ThemeData` inside `MaterialApp`, customizing:

* AppBar color
* Input decoration themes
* Text styles via `TextTheme`
* Button styling

You can control these globally from `utils/app_themes.dart` and reuse shared colors from `utils/app_colors.dart`.

## 🌐 API Integration

The home screen uses a real API — [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) — to fetch and display food categories.
Each list item includes:

* A thumbnail image
* Category title
* A brief description

> 💡 This is like a past project I did using dummy json API that I previously worked with in a JavaScript project. This time, I integrated it using Dart and the `http` package in Flutter.

Would you also like me to add a **"Firebase Setup Steps"** section to this README so anyone cloning your project can configure it easily? (e.g., adding `google-services.json` and `firebase_options.dart`)
